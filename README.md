## Note Taker

This project was designed as a tool for tech support agents at Backstreet Surveillance for them to keep track of notes. 

### How it works 

This is the front-end of the application. The source code is compiled for production and hosted on gh-pages. The app communicates with a back-end REST API hosted on glitch. The API handles data requests and communicates with a MongoDB Atlas database to perform CRUD operations. It is written in Node.JS and uses Express to handle endpoint requests.
